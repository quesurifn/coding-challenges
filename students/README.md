# Requirements 

1. Write a Node.js server using any framework you like that allows you to create a
student and retrieve a list of previously-created students
2. For the purposes of this assignment, a student has just a name and a date of birth
○ you do not have to store the students in a database
3. Write a single-page app in React that communicates with the back end and shows the
list of students with their name and current age, has a form to allow you to add a new
student, and some way of deleting a student
4. Don’t worry about making the page look amazing, we’re not testing on design
skills—but feel free to use something like Bootstrap to get a basic look and feel if you
want
5. Also don’t worry about authentication or security—you can tell us in the interview how
you would have done it if were a “real” application
6. Write a short readme to tell us how to build and run it
7. Send us the code by adding us to your repo or emailing a link (e.g. github)
8. Be prepared to talk about your solution with us
